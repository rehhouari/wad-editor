## Credits

This is based on [Joe's Wad Editor](https://github.com/josephfortune/wad-editor/), he wrote all the logic for processing WAD3 files in the browser and the original interface.

I created a new reactive interface via Petite-Vue and added a couple extra features [(marked with +)](##features)
